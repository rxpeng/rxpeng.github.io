While some people feel empowered and less anxious after online searches, others are more anxious or puzzled, which may affect their health-related behaviors. By taking into account health anxiety, this paper examines the processes by which people transition from online health searches to the pursuit of healthcare assistance. Based on Stimulus Organism Response (S–O-R) framework, a research model was developed to illustrate the psychological mechanisms of how searching experience shapes users' healthcare behavior. Using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach, the results support that the online searches trigger different features of health anxiety, which in turn reinforce further healthcare utilization intention. Results also show that response efficacy positively moderates the relationship between perceived illness likelihood and healthcare utilization intentions, while self-efficacy positively moderates the relationship between perceived illness likelihood and further search intention. Three major recommendations are suggested. Information seekers should rely less on internet searches to alleviate anxiety, and become more aware of, self-monitor, and reduce excessive online health searching. Different stakeholders should orient people to high-quality sources. Healthcare practitioners should engage in improving patient-centered information skills and patients’ health information literacy.","tags":["Online information","Healthcare utilization","Health anxiety","Efficacy beliefs"],"title":"How online searches fuel health anxiety: Investigating the link between health-related searches, health anxiety, and future intention","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As public health professionals strive to promote vaccines for inoculation effort, fervent anti-vaccination movements are marshaling against it. This study is motived by a need to better understand the online discussion around vaccination. We identified the sentiments, emotions and topics of pro- and anti-vaxxers’ tweets, investigated their change since the pandemic started, also further examined the associations between these content features and audiences’ engagement.\nUtilizing a snowball sampling method, data were collected from the Twitter accounts of 100 pro-vaxxers (266,672 tweets) and 100 anti-vaxxers (248,027 tweets). We are adopting a lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis, and structural topic modeling to extract the topics. And we use hurdle negative binomial model to test the relationships among sentiment, emotion, topics and engagement.\nThe sentiment analysis shows that the average sentiment of pro-vaxxers’ tweets is more positive, while of anti-vaxxers’ tweets is more negative. The cues of Trust encourage retweeting and the emotion of Anger encourages likes in general. Topic modeling of tweets yields the top15 topics for pro- and anti-vaxxers separately. Among the pro-vaxxers’ tweets, the topics of “Child protection” and “COVID-19 situation” are positively predicting audiences’ engagement. For anti-vaxxers, the topics of “Supporting Trump”, “Injured children”, “COVID-19 situation”, “Media propaganda”, and “Community building” are more appealing to audiences.\nThis study generates insights into the development of emotionally appealing content and effective vaccine promotion strategies while combating COVID-19 and moving toward a global recovery.\n","date":1654214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654214400,"objectID":"2a4e8f82e0921773ae85c781b48b6526","permalink":"https://rxpeng.github.io/project/vaxxer/","publishdate":"2022-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/vaxxer/","section":"project","summary":"The linguistic regularities and audience engagement of vaccine debate amongst anti-vaxxers and pro-vaxxers on Twitter","tags":["Anti-vaccination","Text mining","Social media"],"title":"The Infinity Vaccine War","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ray Block Jr","Michael Burnham","Kayla Kahn","Rachel X.

The divisive context surrounding the coronavirus pandemic inspires our exploration of risk perceptions and the polarization of mitigation practices (i.e., the degree to which the behaviors of people on the political \"Left\" diverge from those on the \"Right\"\"). Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the political polarization of willingness to comply with mitigation behaviors changes with risk perceptions. Analyses use data from two sources - an original dataset of Twitter posts and a nationally-representative survey. In the Twitter data, negative binomial regression models are used to predict mitigation intent measured using tweet counts. In the survey data, logit models predict self-reported mitigation behavior (vaccination, masking, and social distancing). Findings converged across both datasets, supporting the idea that the links between political orientation and willingness to follow mitigation guidelines depend on perceived risk. People on the Left are more inclined than their Right-oriented colleagues to follow guidelines, but this polarization tends to decrease as the perceived risk of COVID-19 intensifies. Additionally, we find evidence that exposure to COVID-19 infections sends ambiguous signals about the risk of the virus while COVID-19 related deaths have a more consistent impact on mitigation behaviors. Pandemic-related risks can create opportunities for perceived \"common ground,\"\" between the political “Right” and “Left.” Risk perceptions and politics interact in their links to intended COVID-19 mitigation behavior (as measured both on Twitter and in a national survey). Our results invite a more complex interpretation of political polarization than those stemming from simplistic analyses of partisanship and ideology.","tags":["Ideology","Political polarization","Disease mitigation behavior","Risk perception","Social media","Public opinion"],"title":"Perceived risk, political polarization, and the willingness to follow COVID-19 mitigation guidelines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project aims at identifying user’s information needs on Coronavirus and the differences of user’s information needs between the online health community MedHelp and the question-and-answer forum Quora during the COVID-19 global pandemic. We obtained the posts in the sub-community Coronavirus on MedHelp (195 posts with 1627 answers) and under the topic of COVID-19(2019-2020) on Quora (263 posts with 8401 answers) via web scraping built on Selenium WebDriver. After preprocessing, we conducted topic modeling on both corpora and identified the best topic model for each corpus based on the diagnostic evaluation. Leveraging the improved sqrt-cosine similarity measurement, we further compared the topic similarity between these two corpora. This study found that there are common information needs on both platforms about vaccination and basic elements of the disease including the onset symptoms, transmission routes, preventive measures, treatment and control of COVID-19. Some unique discussions on MedHelp are about psychological health, and therapeutic management of patients. Users on Quora have special interests of information about the association between vaccine and Luciferase, and attacks on Fauci after email trove released. The work is beneficial for researchers who aim to provide accurate information assistance and build effective online emergence response programs during the pandemic.\n","date":1641513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641513600,"objectID":"1f3458e2557fa9d54c15e3fc31e5f069","permalink":"https://rxpeng.github.io/project/need/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/need/","section":"project","summary":"A comparison study of information needs between an online health community (MedHelp) and a Q\u0026A platform (Quora)","tags":["COVID-19","Information needs","Text mining","Online health community"],"title":"Understanding Information Needs during COVID-19","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
